# Disassociate stations based on excessive transmission failures or other
# indications of connection loss. This depends on the driver capabilities and
# may not be available with all drivers.
disassoc_low_ack=0

# The station can associate again with the AP if it is still in range;
# this inactivity poll is just used as a nicer way of verifying
# inactivity; i.e., client will not report broken connection because
# disassociation frame is not sent immediately without first polling
# the STA with a data frame.
# default: 300 (i.e., 5 minutes)
ap_max_inactivity=3000

# IEEE 802.11 specifies two authentication algorithms. hostapd can be
# configured to allow both of these or only one. Open system authentication
# should be used with IEEE 802.1X.
# Bit fields of allowed authentication algorithms:
# bit 0 = Open System Authentication
# bit 1 = Shared Key Authentication (requires WEP)
auth_algs=3 #Both open and shared auth

# Send empty SSID in beacons and ignore probe request frames that do not
# specify full SSID, i.e., require stations to know SSID.
# default: disabled (0)
# 1 = send empty (length=0) SSID in beacon and ignore probe request for
#     broadcast SSID
# 2 = clear SSID (ASCII 0), but keep the original length (this may be required
#     with some clients that do not support empty SSID) and ignore probe
#     requests for broadcast SSID
# NB If enable_mana is set above, this option will not prevent hostapd from
# responding to broadcast probe requests, but will remove the ESSID from the
# beacons. If set in conjunction with mana_macacl (see above) it will effectively
# hide the network from "denied" MAC addresses.
#ignore_broadcast_ssid=0 # no SSID cloaking

##### MANA specific configurations ############################################
# MANA attacks include KARMA attacks as well as responding to broadcast probes.
# Enabling this will attempt to attract devices probing for "other" networks.
# If you want a "standard AP" that only looks like one network, don't enable this.
# 0 = disabled - don't perform MANA attacks
# 1 = enabled - perform MANA attacks
enable_mana=0

# By default, MANA will be a little stealthy and only advertise probed for networks
# directly to the device that probed for it.
# However, not all devices probe as much as they used to, and some devices will
# probe with "random" locally administered MAC addresses.
# Loud mode will re-broadcast all networks to all devices.
# 0 = disabled - networks are broadcast at the specific devices looking for them
# 1 = enabled - networks are advertised to all devices
mana_loud=0 # Limit mana to responding only to the device probing (0), or not (1)

# Normal access points MAC ACLs will only work at association level. This option
# will expand MAC ACLs to probe responses.
# It requires macaddr_acl to be set later in the config file to work. This controls
# whether we're operating in black or white list mode. The MACs are defined in the
# files listed in accept_mac_file and deny_mac_file.
# Setting ignore_broadcast_ssid below will also hide the base network from
# non-authorised devices.
# 0 = disabled - MAC ACLs are not applied to probe response frames (default)
# 1 = enabled - MAC ACLs will be extended to probe response frames
mana_macacl=0 # Extend MAC ACLs to probe frames
